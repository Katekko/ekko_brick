Boirlerplate for clean architeture using less libraries

## Getting Started ðŸš€

For now the brick it's not published yet. Waiting the invite for the mason closed beta.

If you wanna try the brick follow the instructions:

- First install the [mason CLI](https://pub.dev/packages/mason_cli)
- Install the [FVM](https://fvm.app/docs/getting_started/installation), it's a CLI for controll the flutter versions from your computer 
- Clone the project
- In the clone directory type:
  - `mason get`
  - `mason make ekko_brick`
    - If you wanna create the project outside this cloned repo, just add the `o` argument like this: `mason make ekko_brick -o <path from where you wanna put the project>`
- Answer the questions provided by the CLI
- Get inside the created folder (will be example if you didn't change the name of the project)
- Type `fvm use`
- Type `fvm flutter create .`
- Now just start the project
- `fvm flutter run -d {windows/mac/chrome/android/ios}`

For further informations about the architecture itself you will need to wait for my tutorial in the future .
